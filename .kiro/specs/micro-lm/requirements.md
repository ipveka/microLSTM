# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to build a very simple, educational language model from scratch. The focus is on creating clean, well-commented code that demonstrates the core concepts of language modeling without the complexity of modern transformer architectures. The model will be designed for learning purposes, with extensive explanations and comments to help understand how language models work at a fundamental level.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer learning about language models, I want a simple character-level language model implementation, so that I can understand the basic mechanics of how neural networks learn to generate text.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the model is trained THEN it SHALL use character-level tokenization for simplicity
2. WHEN processing text THEN the system SHALL convert characters to numerical indices and back
3. WHEN training THEN the model SHALL use a simple neural network architecture (RNN or basic transformer)
4. WHEN generating text THEN the model SHALL predict the next character based on previous characters

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student of machine learning, I want comprehensive code comments and explanations, so that I can understand each step of the implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any code file THEN each function SHALL have detailed docstrings explaining its purpose
2. WHEN reading the code THEN complex operations SHALL have inline comments explaining the logic
3. WHEN examining the training loop THEN each step SHALL be clearly documented
4. WHEN looking at the model architecture THEN the purpose of each layer SHALL be explained

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As someone experimenting with language models, I want to train the model on simple text data, so that I can see how it learns patterns and generates coherent text.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing training data THEN the system SHALL accept plain text files as input
2. WHEN training THEN the model SHALL learn from character sequences and their next character
3. WHEN training completes THEN the system SHALL save the trained model weights
4. WHEN loading a saved model THEN the system SHALL restore the model state for text generation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of the language model, I want to generate text by providing a starting prompt, so that I can see the model's learned patterns in action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing a text prompt THEN the system SHALL generate a continuation of specified length
2. WHEN generating text THEN the model SHALL use sampling or greedy decoding for next character prediction
3. WHEN generating THEN the output SHALL be readable text (not just numbers or tokens)
4. WHEN generation is complete THEN the system SHALL return the full generated text including the original prompt

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple training interface, so that I can easily train the model with different parameters and datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting training THEN the system SHALL accept configurable parameters (learning rate, epochs, etc.)
2. WHEN training THEN the system SHALL display progress information (loss, epoch number)
3. WHEN training THEN the system SHALL allow early stopping or interruption
4. WHEN training completes THEN the system SHALL provide training statistics and final loss

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As someone learning about neural networks, I want to see the model's internal structure and parameters, so that I can understand how the model stores and uses learned information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN inspecting the model THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of the architecture
2. WHEN examining parameters THEN the system SHALL show the number of trainable parameters
3. WHEN analyzing the model THEN the system SHALL provide utilities to visualize weights or activations
4. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL offer methods to inspect intermediate outputs
